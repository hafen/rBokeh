\arguments{
\item{visible}{Is the renderer visible.}

\item{level}{Specifies the level in which to paint this renderer.}

\item{bounds}{Bounds for the rendered grid lines. If unset, the grid lines will span the entire plot in the given dimension.}

\item{band_fill_alpha}{The fill alpha of alternating bands between Grid lines.}

\item{band_fill_color}{The fill color of alternating bands between Grid lines.}

\item{grid_line_alpha}{The line alpha of the Grid lines.}

\item{grid_line_cap}{The line cap of the Grid lines.}

\item{grid_line_color}{The line color of the Grid lines.}

\item{grid_line_dash}{The line dash of the Grid lines.}

\item{grid_line_dash_offset}{The line dash offset of the Grid lines.}

\item{grid_line_join}{The line join of the Grid lines.}

\item{grid_line_width}{The line width of the Grid lines.}

\item{minor_grid_line_alpha}{The line alpha of the minor Grid lines.}

\item{minor_grid_line_cap}{The line cap of the minor Grid lines.}

\item{minor_grid_line_color}{The line color of the minor Grid lines.}

\item{minor_grid_line_dash}{The line dash of the minor Grid lines.}

\item{minor_grid_line_dash_offset}{The line dash offset of the minor Grid lines.}

\item{minor_grid_line_join}{The line join of the minor Grid lines.}

\item{minor_grid_line_width}{The line width of the minor Grid lines.}

\item{clear}{A logical indicating whether all non-specified parameters should be cleared out of any exising specification in the figure. This can be useful when modifying a previously-defined figure.}
