\description{
A tick formatter for displaying datetime values nicely across a range of scales.
}
\details{
This tick formatter has the following properties (listed together with their default values) that can be used to control the formatting of axis ticks at different scales scales:
\itemize{
  \item microseconds --- \code{['\%fus']}
  \item milliseconds --- \code{['\%3Nms', '\%S.\%3Ns']}
  \item seconds --- \code{['\%Ss']}
  \item minsec --- \code{[':\%M:\%S']}
  \item minutes --- \code{[':\%M', '\%Mm']}
  \item hourmin --- \code{['\%H:\%M']}
  \item hours --- \code{['\%Hh', '\%H:\%M']}
  \item days --- \code{['\%m/\%d', '\%a\%d']}
  \item months --- \code{['\%m/\%Y', '\%b\%y']}
  \item years --- \code{['\%Y']}
}

Each scale property can be set to format or list of formats to use for formatting datetime tick values that fall in that "time scale". By default, only the first format string passed for each time scale will be used. By default, all leading zeros are stripped away from the formatted labels.

This list of supported \href{http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strftime.3.html}{strftime} formats is reproduced below.

\itemize{
  \item \code{\%a} --- The abbreviated name of the day of the week according to the current locale.
  \item \code{\%A} --- The full name of the day of the week according to the current locale.
  \item \code{\%b} --- The abbreviated month name according to the current locale.
  \item \code{\%B} --- The full month name according to the current locale.
  \item \code{\%c} --- The preferred date and time representation for the current locale.
  \item \code{\%C} --- The century number (year/100) as a 2-digit integer.
  \item \code{\%d} --- The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31).
  \item \code{\%D} --- Equivalent to \%m/\%d/\%y.  (Americans should note that in many other countries \%d/\%m/\%y is rather common. This means that in international context this format is ambiguous and should not be used.)
  \item \code{\%e} --- Like \%d, the day of the month as a decimal number, but a leading zero is replaced by a space.
  \item \code{\%f} --- Microsecond as a decimal number, zero-padded on the left (range 000000-999999). This is an extension to the set of directives available to `timezone`_.
  \item \code{\%F} --- Equivalent to \%Y-\%m-\%d (the ISO 8601 date format).
  \item \code{\%G} --- The ISO 8601 week-based year with century as a decimal number. The 4-digit year corresponding to the ISO week number (see \%V). This has the same format and value as \%Y, except that if the ISO week number belongs to the previous or next year, that year is used instead.
  \item \code{\%g} --- Like \%G, but without century, that is, with a 2-digit year (00-99).
  \item \code{\%h} --- Equivalent to \%b.
  \item \code{\%H} --- The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00 to 23).
  \item \code{\%I} --- The hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range 01 to 12).
  \item \code{\%j} --- The day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to 366).
  \item \code{\%k} --- The hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 0 to 23). Single digits are preceded by a blank.  (See also \%H.)
  \item \code{\%l} --- The hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 1 to 12). Single digits are preceded by a blank.  (See also \%I.)  (TZ)
  \item \code{\%m} --- The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12).
  \item \code{\%M} --- The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59).
  \item \code{\%n} --- A newline character. Bokeh text does not currently support newline characters.
  \item \code{\%N} --- Nanosecond as a decimal number, zero-padded on the left (range 000000000-999999999). Supports a padding width specifier, i.e. \%3N displays 3 leftmost digits. However, this is only accurate to the millisecond level of precision due to limitations of `timezone`_.
  \item \code{\%p} --- Either "AM" or "PM" according to the given time value, or the corresponding strings for the current locale.  Noon is treated as "PM" and midnight as "AM".
  \item \code{\%P} --- Like \%p but in lowercase: "am" or "pm" or a corresponding string for the current locale.
  \item \code{\%r} --- The time in a.m. or p.m. notation.  In the POSIX locale this is equivalent to \%I:\%M:\%S \%p.
  \item \code{\%R} --- The time in 24-hour notation (\%H:\%M). For a version including the seconds, see \%T below.
  \item \code{\%s} --- The number of seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).
  \item \code{\%S} --- The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60).  (The range is up to 60 to allow for occasional leap seconds.)
  \item \code{\%t} --- A tab character. Bokeh text does not currently support tab characters.
  \item \code{\%T} --- The time in 24-hour notation (\%H:\%M:\%S).
  \item \code{\%u} --- The day of the week as a decimal, range 1 to 7, Monday being 1. See also \%w.
  \item \code{\%U} --- The week number of the current year as a decimal number, range 00 to 53, starting with the first Sunday as the first day of week 01.  See also \%V and \%W.
  \item \code{\%V} --- The ISO 8601 week number (see NOTES) of the current year as a decimal number, range 01 to 53, where week 1 is the first week that has at least 4 days in the new year.  See also \%U and \%W.
  \item \code{\%w} --- The day of the week as a decimal, range 0 to 6, Sunday being 0. See also \%u.
  \item \code{\%W} --- The week number of the current year as a decimal number, range 00 to 53, starting with the first Monday as the first day of week 01.
  \item \code{\%x} --- The preferred date representation for the current locale without the time.
  \item \code{\%X} --- The preferred time representation for the current locale without the date.
  \item \code{\%y} --- The year as a decimal number without a century (range 00 to 99).
  \item \code{\%Y} --- The year as a decimal number including the century.
  \item \code{\%z} --- The +hhmm or -hhmm numeric timezone (that is, the hour and minute offset from UTC).
  \item \code{\%Z} --- The timezone name or abbreviation.
  \item \code{\%\%} --- A literal '\%' character.

\note{
The client library BokehJS uses the \href{http://bigeasy.github.io/timezone/}{timezone} library to format datetimes. The inclusion of the list below is based on the claim that timezone makes to support "the full compliment of GNU date format specifiers." However, this claim has not been tested exhaustively against this list. If you find formats that do not function as expected, please submit a \href{https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues}{github issue}, so that the documentation can be updated appropriately.
