\arguments{
\item{fig}{Figure to modify.}

\item{xs}{The x-coordinates of the region to draw.}

\item{ys}{The y-coordinates of the region to draw.}

\item{color}{Color for the glyph - a hex code (with no alpha) or any of the 147 named CSS colors, e.g 'green', 'indigo'. For glyphs with both fill and line properties, see "Handling color" below.}

\item{alpha}{The alpha transparency of the glyph between 0 (transparent) and 1 (opaque). If the glyph has both fill and color properties, see "Handling alpha" below.}

\item{ys_units}{The unit type for the ys attribute. Interpreted as "data space" units by default. One of "data" or "screen".}

\item{xs_units}{The unit type for the xs attribute. Interpreted as "data space" units by default. One of "data" or "screen".}

\item{line_width}{The line width values for the polygon.}

\item{line_cap}{The line cap values for the polygon.}

\item{line_join}{The line join values for the polygon.}

\item{line_dash}{The line dash values for the polygon.}

\item{line_dash_offset}{The line dash offset values for the polygon.}

\item{lgroup}{Layer group.}

\item{lname}{Layer name.}

\item{\ldots}{additional parameters for fine control over fill and line properties (see "Additional parameters" below)}

\section{Handling color}{
 The \code{color} parameter is a high-level plot attribute that provides default behavior for coloring glyphs.
\itemize{
  \item When using a glyph that only has line properties, this will be the color of the line.
  \item When using a glyph that has has line and fill properties, this will be the color of the line and the fill, with the alpha level of the fill reduced by 50\%.
  \item If full control over fill and line color is desired, the \code{fill_color} and \code{line_color} attributes can be specified explicitly and will override \code{color}.
}
When color is \code{NULL} and \code{fill_color} or \code{line_color} are not specified, the color will be chosen from the theme.
}

\section{Handling alpha}{
 The \code{alpha} is a high-level plot attribute that sets the transparency of the glyph being plotted.
\itemize{
  \item When using a glyph that only has line properties, this will be the alpha of the line.
  \item When using a glyph that has has line and fill properties, this will be the alpha of the line and the alpha of the fill will be set to 50\% of this value.
  \item Individual fill and line alpha can be specified with \code{fill_alpha} and \code{line_alpha} and will override \code{alpha}.
}
}

\section{Additional parameters}{

\tabular{ll}{
  \code{fill_color} \tab color to use to fill the glyph with - a hex code (with no alpha) or any of the 147 named CSS colors, e.g 'green', 'indigo' \cr
  \code{fill_alpha} \tab transparency value between 0 (transparent) and 1 (opaque) \cr
  \code{line_color} \tab color to use to stroke lines with - a hex code (with no alpha) or any of the 147 named CSS colors, e.g 'green', 'indigo' \cr
  \code{line_width} \tab stroke width in units of pixels \cr
  \code{line_alpha} \tab transparency value between 0 (transparent) and 1 (opaque) \cr
  \code{line_join} \tab how path segments should be joined together 'miter' 'round' 'bevel' \cr
  \code{line_cap} \tab how path segments should be terminated 'butt' 'round' 'square' \cr
  \code{line_dash} \tab array of integer pixel distances that describe the on-off pattern of dashing to use \cr
  \code{line_dash_offset} \tab the distance in pixels into the line_dash that the pattern should start from
